## Questions

Some of the features requested are vague and subjective by design and we expect you, if you decide to implement them, to interpret them as you find best for the end result. I.e. it‚Äôs as much about how you interpret the features as how you implement them.

If there are things, however, that are unclear don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us and we will get back to you as soon as possible!

#### Good luck from everyone at BrightBid!
